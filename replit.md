## Cloud Run Deployment Configuration

### Deployment Files

- **.dockerignore**: Excludes development files and assets from Docker build.
- **entrypoint.sh**: Cloud Run startup script with environment validation.
- **start-production.sh**: Production startup script with Node.js memory optimizations.

### Cloud Run Optimizations Applied
- Health check endpoints: `/health` and `/ready` for container health monitoring.
- Graceful shutdown handling with SIGTERM/SIGINT signal processing.
- Request timeout protection (55-minute limit for Cloud Run compatibility).
- Trust proxy configuration for load balancer integration.
- Memory optimization with `--max-old-space-size=1024` flag.
- Startup CPU boost and proper resource allocation.
- Container concurrency set to 1000 for optimal performance.

### Health Check Endpoints
- **GET /health**: Returns server status, timestamp, uptime, and environment.
- **GET /ready**: Returns readiness status for load balancer routing.
- Startup probe: 10 retries with 3-second intervals.
- Liveness probe: Health check every 30 seconds.
- Readiness probe: Continuous readiness validation.

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Deploy to Cloud Run (after setting up Docker registry)
docker build -t gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/thecookflow .
docker push gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/thecookflow
gcloud run deploy thecookflow --image gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/thecookflow --platform managed
```
